# Adobe XD CC

Adobe Xd allows you to wireframe as just part of its suite of prototyping tools, which takes you through the whole process of sketching wireframes; collaboration with your team; creating site maps, flowcharts and storyboards; building functional prototypes; and much more. You can try Adobe Xd out for free but as usual you need a Creative Cloud subscription to take full advantage of Xd's incredible smorgasbord of features.
